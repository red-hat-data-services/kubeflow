# Build the manager binary

ARG SOURCE_CODE=.
ARG GOLANG_VERSION=1.22

# Use ubi8/go-toolset as base image

## Build args to be used at this step
ARG SOURCE_CODE

# Set building workdir
WORKDIR /workspace

# Copy the Go Modules manifests
COPY ${SOURCE_CODE}/notebook-controller ./notebook-controller
# This is necessary because the Jupyter controller now depends on
# components/common
COPY ${SOURCE_CODE}/common ./common

# Update building workdir
WORKDIR /workspace/notebook-controller

## Build the kf-notebook-controller
USER root

# the GOARCH has not a default value to allow the binary be built according to the host where the command
# was called. For example, if we call make docker-build in a local env which has the Apple Silicon M1 SO
# the docker BUILDPLATFORM arg will be linux/arm64 when for Apple x86 it will be linux/amd64. Therefore,
# by leaving it empty we can ensure that the container and binary shipped on it will have the same platform.
